## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties using BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Thanks to this challenge I've learned more about semantic HTML5 tags, to use CSS BEM(Block, Element, Modifier) name convention for the classes and last but not least a better git-github workflow also regarding posting this challenge. And finally a little approach of deploying on Github pages

ðŸ˜… Here is the arcane on how to center a div

```css
.container {
	display: grid;
	place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

For the moment i want to focus more on the basics and when I'll gain more confidence I will move to various frameworks

### Useful resources

- [BEM101](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) : This helped me to have a 'pattern' to follow when I name the classes in html and to give more sense to my css
- [GithubDocs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site): This is about deploying on github pages
